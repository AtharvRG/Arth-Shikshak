## Project Description

**Arth Shikshak** is a Streamlit application designed to provide users with personalized financial guidance and education.

* **Personalized Advice:** The application considers your unique financial situation (income, savings, expenses) to provide tailored recommendations.
* **Financial Education:** Learn about key financial concepts and strategies to improve your financial literacy.
* **Chat History:** Review past conversations to revisit previously discussed topics and advice.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Streamlit provides a simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
* **Accessibility:** Designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their technical expertise.
